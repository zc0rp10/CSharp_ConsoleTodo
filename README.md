# CLI Todo Application in C#
This is the first application I wrote while learning C#. It's a simplistic todo application that rus in the terminal and allows the user to Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks.

The todo tasks are printed out on the terminal for the user and can be sorted based on the criterias, Id, Description or Priority.

All todo tasks are written to and read from a file in the OS application data directory to provide presistence of data between sessions.
